      Apideck is a hydrated, real‑time Unified API platform designed to simplify and accelerate integrations for SaaS companies and developers. Instead of building and maintaining dozens of separate connectors, you can integrate once with Apideck and access a standardized REST API that connects to 135+ services—CRMs, accounting tools, HRIS, e‑commerce, file storage, and more—all in real time with no data caching.
